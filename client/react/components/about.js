    <h1>Me</h1>
    <p>I am a developer who loves to learn new things and think about problems.
      Give me some new tech and I'll sink my teeth into understanding it. My
      interests are far too numerous to list but a few I have already experimented
      with are, web development (as you can see), game design (Unity),
      sculpture (glass), circus acts (contact juggling), and sketching. I love
      thinking about the future of tech and the doors it will open, like how we
      communicate or experience art.</p>
    <h1>This site</h1>
    <p>It is my hope that this site can be my web development shed or garage,
      so to speak. A place to both experiment (the workshop) and show off some things
      I'm proud of (my portfolio). I hope you have fun looking around.</p>
